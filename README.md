SamvaaD Chat Application:
===============================================================================================================================================================================

Problem Statement:

Since we are going through this unfortunate conditions of Covid pandemic, so everything has become online since its arrival.
So to have an interaction all time with our colleague.

Proposed Solution:

So to have a healthy interaction and communication between our friends, chat is a very convinient option, every time call or video call can't be done.
Hence we have developed a communication software application to that provides direct messages in realtime.
You can chat with your friends in a click.
Another idea is that we can have a chat application which is specific to our AIT campus and anybody from the can add features to it{since it is open souce code} to upgrade it. 
Only AITians will use it and update it too [its seems awesome when we can use the app in our campus developed by our own batchmates and upgrading it too as per out demands.]
And there is whole lot of stuffs that can be implemented if we have a campus specific app.

Functionality & Concepts used :

1.Relative Layout and Constraint Layout :

ConstraintLayout provides you the ability to completely design your UI with the drag and drop feature provided by the Android Studio design editor. It helps to improve the UI performance over other layouts. ...
With the help of ConstraintLayout, we can easily add animations to the UI components which we used in our app.

RelativeLayout is a view group that displays child views in relative positions. The position of each view can be specified as relative to sibling elements (such as to the left-of or below another view)
or in positions relative to the parent RelativeLayout area (such as aligned to the bottom, left or center).

2.Buttons in the layout :  Button is a user interface control that is used to perform an action whenever the user clicks or tap on it.
Generally, Buttons in android will contain a text or an icon or both and perform an action when the user touches it. 

3.Firebase Authentication : Firebase Authentication provides backend services, easy-to-use SDKs, and ready-made UI libraries to authenticate users to your app.
It supports authentication using passwords, phone numbers, popular federated identity providers like Google, Facebook and Twitter, and more.

4.Recycler View : What is a RecyclerView?
RecyclerView is the ViewGroup that contains the views corresponding to your data. It's a view itself, so you add RecyclerView into your layout the way you would add any other UI element.
Each individual element in the list is defined by a view holder object.RecyclerView is a ViewGroup added to the android studio as a successor of the GridView and ListView.

5.User Interface and Animation : In splash screen we have used animations to make the app visualy appealing and the user interface is kept simple but with contrasting colors
and gradient colors.

Future Scope:

We can use this app in our AIT campus as a AIT specific chat app, and its source code is open, so any aitian can contribute to it and different features...
as it grows, it will become more polished. It has a lot to do but unitedly if we contribute to it occassionaly, then it can be have an awesome experience...its amazing to have 
an app that we can use in our campus developed by our own batchmates and upgrading it too as per out demands.
